Pre-requisites
--------------

This version of Presence has been developed using Qt 4.5 so the Qt 4.5
library and development tools are needed to build it. It has also been
tested and found to run under Qt 4.6 beta 1.


Building from a downloaded tar.gz file
--------------------------------------

$ qmake
$ make

Note: If you are compiling under Mac you should add the 
'-spec macx-g++' option to qmake in order to generate a GNU makfile.

After building has finished an executable called presence is created
within the qPresence folder.


Building from a git clone
-----------------------------

1) Go to the daemon dir ('/daemon'). 
2) Compile the thing:
   $ qmake
   $ make

Note: If you are compiling under Mac you should add the 
'-spec macx-g++' option to qmake in order to generate a GNU makfile.
